Pay homage to Ansel Adams.  
Jan 9, 2020. Daegu, Korea.  

I saw Ansel Adams' [Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico](http://anseladams.com/ansel-adams-anecdotes/) a few years ago and I was impressed.  
Inspired by his work, I wanted to capture the moonrise of the 21st century by taking a picture of the city, the buildings, and the moon, instead of a large field.

Dec 01, 2017. Gumi, Korea.  

This photo was taken from the top of the mountain.  
But this is not my favourite. Moon is too high. I should have climbed a bit early. Also, there are no buildings and lights on the ground.

There are buildings and lights in this photo, but the moon is slightly hidden because of the clouds.

Feb 05 ~ 09, 2020. 9block 2garden, Daegu, Korea.

And finally, after years of challenge, I was able to take my favourite picture. There are the moon and many buildings, but no clouds.  
I participated in the photo club exhibition this year with this photo.
