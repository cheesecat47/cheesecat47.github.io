I'm trying to make blog using Jekyll and Github Page. More precisely, I'm rely heavily on 'Googling'.
Make categories and make tabs at the top of the page refered to [this blog](https://devyurim.github.io/development%20environment/github%20blog/2018/08/07/blog-6.html){:target="blank"}.

I started programming this code at Jan 1, 2019 and wanted to make this commit to the first in new year, but it's already Jan 2. I could make it a-year-long(?) commit started in 2018 and ended in 2019.
