<!-- APACHE JMeter는 부하 테스트와 퍼포먼스 측정을 위한 오픈소스 프로그램입니다. -->
APACHE JMeter is an open source programme designed to load test functional behaviour and measure performance.

<!-- 다운로드는 <https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi> 여기에서 가능하고, 맥 유저는 -->
You can download on <https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi> here, and

```zsh
$ brew install jmeter
```

<!-- 이렇게도 가능합니다. -->
this could be possible if you are using Mac.

<!-- JMeter 유저 매뉴얼에서는 GUI 모드는 Test Plan을 작성하고 디버깅할 때만 사용하고, 실제 부하 테스트 시에는 CLI를 사용하는 것을 권장합니다. -->
JMeter User Manual suggests that GUI mode should only be used for creating the test plan or debugging, CLI mode (NON GUI) must be used for load testing.

A test plan describes a seriese of steps JMeter will execute when run. A complete test plan will consist of one or more Thread Groups, logic controllers, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements.

JMeter reports warnings and errors to the jmeter.log file, as well as some information on the test run itself.

## Element of a Test Plan

### Thread Group

Thread group elements are the beginning points of any test plan. All controllers and samplers must be under a thread group.
As the name implies, the thread group element controlls the number of threads JMeter will use to execute your test.

The ramp-up period tells JMeter how long to take to "ramp-up" to the full number of threads chosen. Each thread will start (ramp-up period / number of threads) seconds after the previous thread was begun.
